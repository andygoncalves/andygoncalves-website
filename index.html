    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="andy_2017.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/>

    <p>I recently made a career move into management. After 6 and a half years in software engineering, it was quite clear to me that people are the core of any company, and that helping them grow is what really moves the company forward. As such, nurturing growth and helping drive delivery became my main interests, so I made the switch.</p>

    <p>Currently I'm working as an Associate Engineering Manager at Talkdesk, managing one of the core teams of the product.</p>

    <p>After a bunch of months using some fancy, scroll-heavy single page bootstrap template, I got fed up and just remembered <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">the motherfucking website</a>. This version is much more readable and succinct.</p>
